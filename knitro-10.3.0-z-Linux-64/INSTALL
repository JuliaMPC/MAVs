Artelys Knitro 10.3
-------------------

For Knitro to be activated and run on your machine, you must first
obtain and install a valid license file from Artelys or your local
distributor.  These instructions describe a simple procedure for
installing stand-alone, single-computer licenses on a Linux or Unix platform.
For network licensing, or more stand-alone license options, please consult
the Artelys License Manager user manual.     

Stand-alone/Single Computer Licensing
-------------------------------------

For a single machine license, execute "get_machine_ID", a program
supplied with the distribution.  This will generate a machine ID (five
pairs of hexadecimal digits). Email the machine ID to info-knitro@artelys.com
if purchased through Artelys. (If Knitro was purchased through a
distributor, then email the machine ID to your local distributor.)
Artelys (or your local distributor) will then send a license file of the
form "artelys_lic_name.txt".  The file name is arbitrary, so long as it
begins with "artelys_lic".  The license file is made available to Knitro
on a Linux or Unix platform in any one of the following ways: 

- Put "artelys_lic_name.txt" in your $HOME directory.
- Put "artelys_lic_name.txt" in the directory in which you run Knitro.
- Set the environment variable ARTELYS_LICENSE to the location of the file
    (e.g.,  export ARTELYS_LICENSE=/home/subdirectory/artelys_lic_name.txt).
