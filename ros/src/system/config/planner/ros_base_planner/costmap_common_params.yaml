#The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from
#obstacles at which a cost should be incurred. For example, setting
#paths that stay 0.55 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal
#the inflation radius at 0.55 meters means that the robot will treat all obstacle cost.

#The "marking" and "clearing" parameters determine whether the sensor
#will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, clear obstacle
#information from the costmap, or do both.
